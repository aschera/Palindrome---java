# Palindrome---java
Program must prompt the user to enter a string. 
The program must then test the string entered by the user to determine whether it is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards, such as "radar", "racecar", 
and "able was I ere I saw elba". It is customary to ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization 
when looking for palindromes. For example, "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama!" is considered to be a palindrome.

To determine whether a string is a palindrome, you can: convert the string to lower case; remove 
any non-letter characters from the string; and compare the resulting string with the reverse of the 
same string. If they are equal, then the original string is considered to be a palindrome.
